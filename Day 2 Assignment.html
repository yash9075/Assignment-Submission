            <p> <img src="https://logos-download.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/HTML5_badge.png" alt=""> The HyperText
                Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
                scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                included cues for the appearance of the document.

                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
                as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
                documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
                and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
                surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p> <img src="https://maxcdn.icons8.com/Share/icon/Logos/css31600.png" alt=""> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
                specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
                the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
                styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
                or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
                the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
